        "\n",
        "#### 1. Fuzzy Sets\n",
        "A fuzzy set is a generalization of a classical (crisp) set. In a classical set, an element either belongs or does not belong to a set. In a fuzzy set, elements have degrees of membership to the set, typically represented by a membership function that maps elements to a real number in the interval [0, 1]. A value of 0 means the element is not in the set, and 1 means it is fully in the set. Values between 0 and 1 indicate partial membership.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let $X$ be a universe of discourse. A fuzzy set $A$ in $X$ is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$A = \\{ (x, \\mu_A(x)) \\mid x \\in X \\}$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $\\mu_A(x)$ is the membership function of $A$, representing the degree of membership of $x$ in $A$.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Fuzzy Set Operations\n",
        "\n",
        "Given two fuzzy sets $A$ and $B$ on the same universe of discourse $X$, with membership functions $\\mu_A(x)$ and $\\mu_B(x)$ respectively, the basic fuzzy set operations are defined as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Union (A \\cup B)**:\n",
        "    The membership function for the union of two fuzzy sets $A$ and $B$ is defined as the maximum of their individual membership degrees for each element $x$.\n",

        "#### 3. Cartesian Product (Fuzzy Relation)\n",
        "\n",
        "A fuzzy relation $R$ between two fuzzy sets $A$ and $B$ (defined on universes $X$ and $Y$ respectively) is a fuzzy set in the Cartesian product space $X \\times Y$. Its membership function $\\mu_R(x, y)$ indicates the strength of the relationship between elements $x$ from $A$ and $y$ from $B$.\n",

        "The Cartesian product of two fuzzy sets $A$ (on $X$) and $B$ (on $Y$) is a fuzzy relation $R = A \\times B$ on $X \\times Y$, with its membership function defined as:\n",

        "#### 4. Max-Min Composition of Fuzzy Relations\n",
        "\n",
        "Max-min composition is a fundamental operation for combining two fuzzy relations. Given two fuzzy relations $R_1$ on $X \\times Y$ and $R_2$ on $Y \\times Z$, their max-min composition, denoted as $R_1 \\circ R_2$, is a fuzzy relation on $X \\times Z$.\n",
